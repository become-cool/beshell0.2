 I. Introduction

The Wen Quan Yi bitmap font is a manually fine-tuned
multi-strike bitmap font for on-screen display of Chinese 
(traditional and simplified). It has arguably the most complete 
coverage for Chinese characters among all known open-source 
fonts, including CJK Unified Ideograph (U4E00 - U9FA5) and 
CJK Unified Ideograph Extension A (U3400 - U4DB5) glyphs 
at four different sizes (9pt-12X12 pixel, 10pt-13X13 pixel, 
11pt-15X15 pixel, 12pt-16x16 pixel) and two weights 
(medium and bold). Use this font in web pages and elsewhere 
eliminates the annoying "blurring" problems caused by 
the high stroke density of many Chinese characters and 
insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased Chinese fonts. 
This font also provides bitmap glyphs for Basic Latin,
Japanese Hiragana (U3040 - U309F) and Katakana (U30A0 - U30FF).

This font was built upon the previous works by firefly
(firefly[at]firefly(dot)idv(dot)tw)[2]. The 12pt bitmap
glyphs between U3400-U9FA5 were derived from Chinese 
national standard GB19966-2005 [3].

We release this font to the public as an open-source software 
in terms of GPL. You are free to copy, distribute, and/or 
modify this font as long as you pass the freedoms to the users
of the derived work.

We hope you find this font useful. Please send your feedback,
bug-reports to our forum at

  http://wenq.org/forum/

 III. About The WenQuanYi Project

The Wen Quan Yi Project was founded by Qianqian Fang[5] in 
Oct. 2004. The goal of this project is to advocate open-source 
Chinese software/resources and construct an open language
platform for Eastern Asia (Chinese, Japanese and Korean etc) 
open source communities. The initial effots of the project focused
on creating high quality bitmap character glyphs and outline 
fonts for all 70,000+ CJK characters currently encoded 
by the Unicode Consortium [4]. 

The contributors of the Wen Quan Yi Project use they wiki[1] 
as the primary development tool for glyph creation, documentation
and coordinations. The Wen Quan Yi wiki also supports
glyph CVS and nightly build.

The embodiment of the project consists of a 
"Steering Committee" by the core members, a "Team B" 
for bitmap Chinese font development and a "Team V" 
for outline font development. Need to mention, a large 
number of anonymous contributors also participate our 
development through our Wiki website and their 
contributions are non-negligible.
